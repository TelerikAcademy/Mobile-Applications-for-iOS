# Repository for the "Mobile applications for iOS" course

##  Course description

The **"Mobile applications for iOS"** course introduce the fundamental and advanced principles and know-how for creating applications for iPhone and iPad. The course will cover both Objective-C and Swift programming languages in detail, with a bit of C. Some of the topics in the course are: *Graphics and Animations*, *Storyboards and transitions*, *CoreData and SQLite*, *Touch and Gestures*, building a sustainable and reusable architecture, dependecy injection and more
