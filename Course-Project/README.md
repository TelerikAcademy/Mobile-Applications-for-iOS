# Mobile Applications for iOS

Each student develops a mobile application for iOS (iPhone and/or iPad). The application should comply with the requirements for either [Game application](GAME_APP_REQUIREMENTS.md) or [Line-of-business application](LOB_APP_REQUIREMENTS.md).

##  General Requirements

- The application must be **fully working**
  - Just a project concept or an incomplete application is not sufficient and will not get full points for features
- The application must be hosted in http://github.com
  - With at least 10 commits within range of at least 5 days
  - The following will result in points reduction:
    - Less than 10 commits
    - 90% of application written within 48 hours
- **Each student must have absolute comprehension of their own project**
  - Anything **less than full and complete understanding** of the project will be **considered suspicious and will lead to unwanted by both parties results**   

##  Project Defense Requirements

Each student who wants to defend their project in front of a trainer and pass the course has to meet the following requirements:

- Course registration at http://telerikacademy.com/Courses/Courses/Details/311
- Project documentation submitted no later than 23:59 on February 3
  - Requirements for the project documentation can be found [here](#requirements-documentation)

##  Examination procedure

Students have **20 minutes** to present their application to a trainer. The deadline for the development of the application is 17:00 AM, 8 February 2016. Any commit after that time will be excluded from the defense version of the application.

The examination for each student will be done as follows:

1. The trainer checks out the application from the application repository on their device
  - The **lastest version submitted before the deadline** is checked out
- The student presents:
  - The short video on http://youtube.com
  - Their application registered in http://best.telerikacademy.com. All registered applications should include:
    - Link to student's [Github](http://github.com) repository
    - Images of the application
    - Link to the recorded video on http://youtube.com
  - Any missing component of the above will result in lower project points
- The student has **20 minutes** to present their application as follows:
  - 5 minutes for the **application concept**
  - 10 minutes for **explanation of the code** and how it **meets the requirements** of a [Game application](/GAME_REQUIREMENTS.md) or [Line-of-business application](/LOB_APP_REQUIREMENTS.md)
  - 5 minutes for **questions by trainer**
- The student **must answer all questions** of the trainer, concerning their application
  - Any unanswered questions about the code and/or the application can lead to score penalties
  - Any **hint of lack of understanding** of a component of the application results in **fewer or no** project points
- The trainer prepares writtern feedback on each student application
  - This is done without the presence of the student

- Each student will receive **their personal feedback** from the trainer **after the examination of all students is finished**
- The defense is public and any observers can attend the defense of other students
  - It is actually preferable as it **strengthens the objectivity of the evaluation**
  - The observers must keep quiet and **do not disturb the defense** in any way

##  Requirements-documentation

Each student who wants to take the course and defend their application must write brief documentation of their application.

The documentation must include:

- 1-3 paragraphs with the application concept
- 3-8 bullet poins of the functionality
- Images with sample UI of the application (optional)

Write your documentation in english in **Markdown** and commit it as **README.md** of your repository
