# Mobile Applications for iOS

Each student develops an mobile application for iOS (iPhone and/or iPad). The application must follow the requirements for either [Game application](GAME_APP_REQUIREMENTS.md) or [Line-of-business Application](LOB_APP_REQUIREMENTS.md).

##  General Requirements

- The application must be **fully working** application
  - Just an idea and/or not-fully-finished application is not good enough and will not get full points for features
- The application must be hosted in http://github.com
  - With at least 10 commits during a range of days
  - The following will result in reduction of the points:
    - Less than 10 commits
    - 90% of application written in a range of 48 hours

##  Project Defense Requirements

Each student that wants to defend their project in-front of a trainer and take the course will meet the following requirements:

- Registered for the course at http://telerikacademy.com/Courses/Courses/Details/311
- Send a project documentation no later than 23:59 on February 3
  - Requirements for the project documentation can be found [here](#requirements-documentation)

##  Examination procedure

Students have **20 minutes** to present their application to a trainer. The deadline for the development of the application is 10:00 AM, 8 February 2016. Any commit after that time will be excluded from the defense version of the application.

The examination for each student will be done as follows:

1. The trainer checks-out the application from the repository of the application on their device
  - The version that is checked out is the **last before the deadline**
- The student shows:
  - The short video, uploaded in http://youtube.com
  - Their application registered in http://best.telerikacademy.com
    - With link to their [Github](http://github.com) repository
    - Images of the application
    - Link to the recorded video in http://youtube.com
  - Any missing component of the above will result in lower project points
- The student has **20 minutes** to present their application as follows:
  - 5 minutes for the **idea of the application**
  - 10 minutes for **explanation of the code** and how it **follows the requirements** of a [Game Application](/GAME_REQUIREMENTS.md) or [Line-of-business application](/LOB_APP_REQUIREMENTS.md)
  - 5 minutes for **questions by trainer**
- The student **must answer all questions** of the trainer, concerning their application
  - Any not answered question about the code and/or the application can lead to unwanted results by both parties
  - Any **hint of lack of understanding** of a component of the application results in **lower or none** of the project points
- The trainer writes down a feedback for the application of the student
  - This is done without the presence of the student

- Each student will receive **their personal feedback** from the trainer **after the examination of all students is finished**

##  Requirements-documentation

Each student that wants to take the course and defend their application in-front of a trainer must write a brief documentation of their application.

The documentation must include:

- 1-3 paragraphs with the idea of the application
- 5-8 bullets of the functionality
- Optionally, include images with sample UI of the application
